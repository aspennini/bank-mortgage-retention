Modeling Mortgage Customer Retention with Binary Logistic Regression

Project Summary
A bank, looking to prevent the loss of mortgage customers at the end of the ‘lock-in’ period,
asked for an analysis of customers’ personal circumstances to determine if any variables
significantly influence the customer’s decision to stay or leave the bank. An analysis was
performed using binary logistic regression to model the bank data and model selection was
performed using forward stepwise selection with assessment criteria of Akaike Information
Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, McFadden R-squared, and classification tables. The
analysis resulted in a model that shows a significant relationship between a customer’s
account status and their choice in being a branch user, a direct/telephone user and having an
agent.
